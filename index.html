<p id="cool"> Hii! My name is Anjelina (An-hell-ee-na) and I’m a 15 year old latina in high school that’s interested in STEM! I first started having an interest in STEM in elementary school because I was in an after school math program called “Kumon”, and in that program I not only became advanced in mathematics, but I also developed a passion for math which was my first step into STEM! Later on, my sister started introducing computer science to me, as she was pursuing it, and so as soon as I started high school, I started joining every comp sci program I could get into! Throughout this website, you will learn all about the programs I participated in that are STEM related! Have fun :)
